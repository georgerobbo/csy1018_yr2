                    The second job I have chosen is a Senior designer at
                    <b>Hugo Games</b>. Based in Nottingham, they are one of the leading providers in mobile games. This position
                    is for someone with more experience within the field of designer and obviously more experience in games
                    especially is beneficial. Experience of the whole production cycle of a product is essential and knowing
                    F2P (free to play) games inside and out is an asset Hugo Games are wanting you to bring to the table.
                    Being a senior member of the team, you are also expected to be able to mentor other members of the team
                    and get the most out of them. Unlike the other job less benefit are explicitly stated, however, it does
                    say that youâ€™ll be in a fun working environment and have company benefits. A personal love for mobile
                    games is also listed.

        <div class="outro"> The two jobs while for different fields, have many of the same requirements regarding knowledge and many similar
            benefits, working in a computer driven environment while at a smaller company seems to be beneficial and offer
            a lot of enjoyment for a job.</div>
