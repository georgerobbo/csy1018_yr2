        <div class="description"> I chose the general computing as my pathway due to my indecisiveness on what speciality I wanted to do in the future.
            Doing this pathway gave me a more generic view of the course and allowed me to practice all fields rather than
            specialising in just one.

                    Computer communications is the field of how computers connect. In this module we learn to understand the principles of how
                    computers communicate. Deeper into this we look at the internet model in both osi and tcp/ip forms. We
                    look at the types of networks. We also look at different types of protocol, what they do and how they
                    work. We also look at the fundamentals behind a network like the devices and addressing of it and also
                    learn how to set up a network.

                    Databases are a vital part of the computing world regardless of what field you are in. We undertake the design of a database
                    applications and translate and implement into physical database structures using leading software and
                    languages such as Oracle, MySQL and Structured Query Language (SQL). Knowing how databases function and
                    how to manipulate them gives a higher chance and advantage when looking for jobs and employment, essentially
                    giving it the upmost importance in the computing field.

                    In operating systems, we get to figure out and analyse how the backend of operating systems work. The practical side of the
                    course is using Linux, specifically the centOS distribution of it. We learn to understand shell scripts
                    which allow us to manage a server. We also get introduced to python. The theory side of the course, doesnâ€™t
                    relate to any particular operating system and we cover file handling, processes and scheduling, to name
                    a few.

                    In Systems design and development, we work with the java language. In this we learn how to code different kinds of programmes.
                    Java is an easy language to learn to make it useful if you need to create something quick. We also learn
                    how it works with other classes and tables to make decisions.

                    a fully function and visually appealing website. We also learn how to use github which is a very powerful
                    resource. We also learn JS to allow us to make out websites even more functional.
