                    Keeping your branding consistent allows clients to build a mental image of your brand just by looking at it. Keeping it consistent
                    allows you to manipulate how the customer sees your business but will also give them an idea of the kind
                    of product you provide. This carries over to social media also.

                    Making a layout that’s intuitive and easy for the customer to use and navigate around is the difference between a good and
                    bad website. Making sure that you cater for the varying computer skills of possible clients makes your
                    website look much more appealing and will help them get to the right place of the site with ease.

                    SEO (search engine optimisation) is the process of getting traffic from general searches. Good SEO makes your website appear
                    as the best or first result provided by search engines such as Google or Bing. Being at the top makes
                    you website more clickable as people will presume it as the best result or the specific result they’re
                    looking for.

                    Writing your code to a standard recognised to all is a huge must when working in a team. Writing it to a standard means other
                    people can recognise when looking at it. Clean code also means that websites load faster. Writing clear
                    code also helps the verification of the site.
