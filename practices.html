                    Knowing your target audience is a key to having a successful website. Making sure your website caters for the people you

                    Keeping your branding consistent allows clients to build a mental image of your brand just by looking at it. Keeping it consistent
                    allows you to manipulate how the customer sees your business but will also give them an idea of the kind
                    of product you provide. This carries over to social media also.

                    Making a layout that’s intuitive and easy for the customer to use and navigate around is the difference between a good and

                    website look much more appealing and will help them get to the right place of the site with ease.

                    SEO (search engine optimisation) is the process of getting traffic from general searches. Good SEO makes your website appear
                    as the best or first result provided by search engines such as Google or Bing. Being at the top makes
                    you website more clickable as people will presume it as the best result or the specific result they’re
                    looking for.

                    Writing your code to a standard recognised to all is a huge must when working in a team. Writing it to a standard means other

                    code also helps the verification of the site.

                The first website that I came across was Nimbus 9. They help business save money by automating lights and thermostats. The
                main thing that I pulled from this website was the large banner at the top with the faded image with the
                text overlapping. I really like this style of design and really tried to replicate it across to mine. Being
                the first one I looked at I took the navigation of it also putting it over to the right a little the whole
                website is very well designed with images fading/traveling into the view.

                Sunway are a blind manufacturer in Australia who can custom make blinds to your requirements and tastes. I looked at more
                website after I had designed it. This meant that these websites didn’t take as big of an influence as I’d
                have liked them to. Their website features a range of different web animations on images and buttons. I really
                liked the simplicity and sharpness of their website as it makes it look extra professional and easy to navigate.
                The way the images pop on the page and stand out is something that I really liked and tried to replicate
                a little on this page.

                Propeller are a digital design agency. I first saw this website when researching for jobs. I like the ‘tagline’ that appears
                on their website and decided to use it on my glossary and throughout other pages. This website, as it is
                made by a design agency is as you can imagine. Extremely well designed. It has a style of class to it making
                it very appealing to their potential clients.
